NetServ Active Streaming prototype:

Origin Server controls the NetServ Node:
Various commands:
1. PREPARE - prepares the netserv node to start downloading the stream from the streaming server.
2. LIVE - returns the live stream to the client.
3. PASSIVE - returns the cached file from the local repository, file size increases dynamically.
4. VOD - video is served as a static file from the local cache.
5. STOP_DOWNLOAD - Origin server can send this command to stop the stream download

TODO:
1. Multiple client live stream, using circular buffer.
2. The Streaming in VM is very slow, any other suggestions ?
